\section{Introduction}
\begin{mytitle}[Ubiquitous computing] Ubiquitous computing is a vision of how we will live and interact with future computing environments. Examples include network embedded systems, wireless sensor networks, wireless communications, distributed systems, mobile devices and human-computer interaction.

\begin{mytitle}[Important aspects of Mark Weiser's vision] His vision has a broad background, inspired by social scientists, philosophers and anthropologists. He feels like the most powerful things are those that are effectively invisible in use. For him, ubiquitous computing means that computing doesn't live on a personal device of any sort, but it is in the woodwork everywhere.

\begin{mytitle}[Synonyms to ubiquitous computing] There are many synonyms due to different people giving different names to similar visions. Examples are pervasive computing by Lou Gerstner from IBM, ambient intelligence from Emile Aarts from Philips Research and things that think from Neil Gerstenfield at MIT.

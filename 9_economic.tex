\section{Economical Aspects}
\begin{mytitle}[Servitization] Servitization defines the departure from just producing physical goods towards a combination of physical goods and services. The desired continued economic sutainability (market pull) and technological innovation (technology push) drive servitization through digitalization. Because there is a large "installed base" and there are usually higher margins in the service business, there is an economic incentive to shift to aftermarket services.

\begin{mytitle}[Risk and drawbacks]
    \begin{mysubtitle}[Risks for service providers] Risks include erosion of economics of scale, availability is king thus penalty clauses directly impact profitability, the temptation to be too ambitious with promises and that the promises to the customers might require additional resources.
    \end{mysubtitle}
    \begin{mysubtitle}[Risks for customers] Risks include the product/ecosystem lock-in and no legal ownership of the product means there are constraints on the own operations.

\begin{mytitle}[New business model patterns]\hfill
\begin{itemize}
    \item Physical freemium: Sell asset together with a free digital service but premium services are available.
    \item Digital add-on: Sell asset very inexpensively but customers can purchase higher-margin digital services. Invite third parties to sell add-ons as well.
    \item Digital lock-in: Limit the product compatibility to prevent counterfeits and ensure warranty.
    \item Product as point-of-sales: Product takes on a marketing/sales role.
    \item Object self-service: Smart items that place orders on the internet themselves.
\end{itemize}
